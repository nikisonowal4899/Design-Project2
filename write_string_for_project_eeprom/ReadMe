This Code for the Arduino writes and reads data from the EEPROM. All the data strings are stored in EEPROM for saving space
in the Microcontroller. Also most importantly the password is saved in the EEPROM. For the first time we write a default
password in the EEPROM and later we can change the password by the keyboard interface.
In case we forget our saved password we can use this programme for retriving the changed password.
